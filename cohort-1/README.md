# careers-in-code-sandbox
A sandbox for students to manage their code

## Setup

1. In a terminal, navigate to a folder where you'd like to keep your local copy, then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/hackupstate/careers-in-code-sandbox.git
```

2. Open the cloned repository in VSCode, and create a folder for your work:

3. Remember to add a `README.md` file to your folder (or at least one file of any kind) so that Git will have something to commit!

## Git Commands

- `git log` - print a log of recent commits (scroll to the top to see most recent, then type `q` to quit)
- `git status` - print status of your local copy
- `git add .` - stage "unstaged files" (red) so they're ready to commit
- `git status` - run this again, the staged files should now be green
- `git commit -m "my message"` - commit the staged files with a message
- `git pull` - make sure you have the latest from the cloud
- `git push` - push your new commit up to GitHub
